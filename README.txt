Yarn Ninja: Stealth Slaying is a tactical 2D Unity Game created by Karim Khalil (kkhalil5 251070404), Alexander Boulos (aboulos4 251065092), & Omar Aweidah (Oaweidah 251090855).
In this version of the game, the player controls a character named Ming with the goal of eliminating enemies by swinging on orange balls of yarn placed around the screen and colliding with these enemies.
The player can progress through the 4 playable levels by reaching the green yarn after eliminating all enemies. Beware of the spikes and saws, as those are deadly, and will force the player to restart the level.
In the first level, the player has the ability to: grapple using their family's heirloom yarn (Stronger than any material known to man) using left mouse click, and double jump mid air using space bar (jumping also halts all movement and causes Ming to go up only).
Progressing to the second level unlocks a dash ability which can be used by the player by pressing the a & d keys to dash left and right respectively.
Progressing to the third level maintains the previous character functionalities, but unlocks a new walking enemy model to defeat. (As well as other traps so beware)
Finally, reaching the fourth level allows the player to take revenge on their fallen grandmother by fighting the final boss. 
This boss is highly skilled at close range combat and cannot be attacked from the front; therefore the player must land 3 consecutive attacks from behind the boss to eliminate him.
Yarn Ninja outlines these functionalities to the player with scenes in between levels, if they choose to not read this file.


In terms of what we would have liked to add to the game and hopefully will in the future, the following ideas come to mind:
1. Having new skins unlockable by collecting shurikens placed around the levels. Unlocking grandma skin after eliminating the final boss.
2. More options such as screen resolution selection and screen size selection and Volume control as well.
3. Also many more levels would also be added, with different maps with a combination of all the previous traps + new models. 
   These would either be added as different levels, or sequels to Yarn Ninja : Stealth Slaying
4. More boss fights with different mechanics (Some shoot at you, some follow you etc). 

For ease of testing the game was made to run on PC, however it was designed in a way that very mimimal tweaks would be required to convert it into a mobile version.
The overall design of the game is very efficient, and if any other future traps (things that kill the player) or moveable platforms (Implemented method just used on a platform not only a trap) need to be added, they can be done so with ease.
Also if any controls need changing, these can also be changed easily within the build files (Not going into scripts).
